* This is part of the OpenFlexure microscope, an open-source      *
* microscope and 3-axis translation stage.  It gets really good   *
* precision over a ~10mm range, by using plastic flexure          *
* mechanisms.                                                     *
*                                                                 *
* This file defines one useful function, picam_push_fit().  It is *
* designed to be subtracted from a solid block, with the bottom   *
* of the block at z=0.  It grips the plastic camera housing with  *
* four slightly flexible fingers, which ensures the camera pops   *
* in easily but is held relatively firmly.  Two screw holes are   *
* also provided that should self-tap with M2 or similar screws.   *
* I recommend you use these for extra security if the camera is   *
* likely to be handled a lot.                                     *
*                                                                 *
