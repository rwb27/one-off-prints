# Raspberry Pi camera adapter for Motic BA210E microscope
A camera tube for the Motic BA210E microscope, including a lens to match the sensor size to the field of view.  You need two M2 screws, a Raspberry Pi camera module, and a 63mm focal length, 16mm diameter lens.

Everything here is released under the CERN open hardware license.  Feel free to contact me if you'd like to use something commercially and want support or a different license.

The top-level SCAD file is "optics.scad" (a hangover from the [OpenFlexure Microscope](http://www.github.com/rwb27/openflexure_microscope), which is where most of this code came from).
