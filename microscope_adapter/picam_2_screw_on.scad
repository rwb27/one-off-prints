* OpenFlexure Microscope: Raspberry Pi Camera v2 push-fit mount   *
*                                                                 *
* This is part of the OpenFlexure microscope, an open-source      *
* microscope and 3-axis translation stage.  It gets really good   *
* precision over a ~10mm range, by using plastic flexure          *
* mechanisms.                                                     *
*                                                                 *
* This file provides two parts for the microscope; the bit that   *
* fits onto the camera (picam2_camera_mount) and a cover that     *
* protects the PCB (picam_cover).  The former is part of the      *
* optics module in optics.scad, and the latter is printed         *
* directly.                                                       *
*                                                                 *
* The fit is set by one main function, picam2_push_fit().  It's   *
* designed to be subtracted from a solid block, with the bottom   *
* of the block at z=0.  It grips the plastic camera housing with  *
* four slightly flexible fingers, which ensures the camera pops   *
* in easily but is held relatively firmly.  Two screw holes are   *
* also provided that should self-tap with M2 or similar screws.   *
* I recommend you use these for extra security if the camera is   *
* likely to be handled a lot.                                     *
*                                                                 *
