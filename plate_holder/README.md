# Holder for multi-well plates
This is a holder for multi-well plates, to stop them skidding around the bench while you pipette stuff into them.  It’s in two parts: the plate holder (which can be used on its own) and a “bucket” that can be filled with ice to keep the plate cold.  The bucket also keeps the whole thing more rigid.

The bucket should be fitted with a non-slip base.  Either rubber feet, a rubber base, or some double-sided sticky tape would do nicely.

Both STL files are generated from the same SCAD file - just set “top_part” or “bottom_part” to true respectively.
