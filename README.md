# one-off-prints
3D models for random stuff I've printed, usually around the lab.  These are not necessarily fit for purpose or adequately documented, but I thought it was high time I made them public anyway.

Unless specified, everything here is released under the CERN open hardware license.  Feel free to contact me if you'd like to use something commercially and want support or a different license.
